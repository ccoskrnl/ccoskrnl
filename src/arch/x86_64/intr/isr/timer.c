     *
     * @In one-short mode, the value of initial-count register is copied into the
     * current-count register and count-down begins. After the timer reaches zero,
     * a timer interrupt is generated and the timer remians at its 0 value until
     * reprogrammed.
     *
     * In periodic mode, its mechanism is basically similar to one-shot mode, it
     * only differs in that the current-count register is automatically reloaded
     * from the initial-count register when the count reaches 0 and the count-down
     * is repeated.
     *
     * @note A write of 0 to the initial-count register effectively stops the local APIC
     * timer, in both one-shot and periodic mode.
     *
     * TSC-deadline mode allows software to use the local APIC timer to signal an
     * interrupt at an absolute time. Unlike one-shot and periodic mode using
     * initial-count and current-count registers, these registers will be ignored
     * in TSC-deadline mode. Instead, timer behavior is controlled using the
     * IA_32_TSC_DEADLINE MSR.
