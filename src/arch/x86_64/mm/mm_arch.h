/*

Kernel takes Page Directory Self-mapping scheme from Windows NT. 

The key of the scheme is that a item of PML4 points PML4 self. And the item is randomized
, meaning the base address of PML4 also is randomized, which further means the base address
is different every time the memory management is initialized. What's even more important is
that PML4 entry, PDPT entry, PD entry and PT entry are all compatible. So that every entry in 
PML4 also can be as PDPT entry. In the same way, PDPT entry, PD entry and PT entry are the 
same as PML4 entry.
